## Genaral Info
This project is a portfolio project that I built for the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Career Path. 

When run, the project prints out to the term a randomly generated daily affirmation using words from 3 different arrays. The format of the daily affirmation is based on the one used by Stuart Smalley in the SNL skit "Daily Affirmations with Stuart Smalley".

```
- Install Node.js if you don't already have it installed on your machine
- Finally, while in the daily-affirmations directory, type
